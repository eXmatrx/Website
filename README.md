# Alian's Journey Website
This website contains my projects, blogs and more.

[![Netlify Dev Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/44ecf80d-e9a9-424c-be28-0da94603d206/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/aliandead/deploys)

[6/13/2023] -> Yep, the website looks ugly, I'm focusing on the core UI and interactions. Details will come later.
               I'm not too much of a front-end web developer either, so you will have to create an "issue" on GitHub if you want to contribute!
